# Book it

## Inspiration
Service providers such as hairdressers, cleaning workers, massage therapists, photographers, personal trainers, among others, have no way to earn money during the quarantine time. They also can't plan ahead, since they don't know when they are going to be able to work again. Once the curfew is relaxed or lifted, people will need those services again, so why not sell appointments in advance?

This idea was posted by Nikolas Engelhard on the discordApp and developed by Saitel Agudelo.
